  <p>All participants in the tech304 chat are expected to follow the code of conduct. Administrators/moderators will enforce this code.</p>
  <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
  <p>tech304 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any chat topic.

  <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
  <p>Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
  <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify an <a href="/moderators/">administrator/moderator</a> immediately, or via <a href="mailto:tech304@intarwebs.com">email</a>.</p>
